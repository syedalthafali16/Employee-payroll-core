# Employee Payroll Management System (Core Java Practice)

This project was created as a **practice project** to strengthen my understanding
of **Core Java concepts** and basic application structure.

The goal of this project is **learning**, not feature completeness.

---

## Concepts Practiced

- Core Java fundamentals
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Exception handling
- File handling using Java I/O
- Separation of concerns (model, service, util)
- Basic Java Swing UI (for learning purpose)

## ⚙️ Features

- Add Full-Time employees
- Add Part-Time employees
- Salary calculation based on employee type
- File-based data persistence
- View employees using a simple Swing table

---

## 📁 Data Storage

Employee data is stored in a local text file using Java file handling.
This approach was chosen to focus on **Core Java** rather than databases.

---

## 📝 Notes

- This project was built purely for **learning and practice**
- Some validations (like unique employee ID) are intentionally not enforced
- UI is basic and meant only to demonstrate Java Swing integration

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository represents my **learning journey with Java** and is not intended
to be a production-ready system.
